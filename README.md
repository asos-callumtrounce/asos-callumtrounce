## Hi :wave:,
My name is Callum, an **iOS Engineer** on the Web and Apps Team. 

I joined ASOS on July 2019.

I previously worked at a start-up digital agency, where I assisted in scaling the iOS Engineering Team from 5 to 20. It have the experience and a background working in a fast-paced environment in cross-functional teams, operating across multiple tech stacks and communicating with internal/external stakeholders.
