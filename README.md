## Hi :wave:,
My name is Callum, an **iOS Engineer** on the Web and Apps Team. 

I joined ASOS on July 2019.

I previously worked at a start-up digital agency, where I assisted in scaling the iOS Engineering Team from 5 to 20. It have the experience and a background working in a fast-paced environment in cross-functional teams, operating across multiple tech stacks and communicating with internal/external stakeholders.

### Some Areas of focus
I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. My areas of focus don't limit me in what I can explore.

#### 📈 Experimentation and Measurement 📏
Rapid iteration and feedback loops delivers better quality in the long term, and gives better insight into how our changes impact user behaviour, allowing us to be more in touch with our customers.  
- Point of contact for Experimentation on the iOS Platform. 
- I maintain the `ASOSExperimentation` iOS Project and the `URL Injection Framework`
- Maintain the [iOS Experimentation Documentation](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/2117176939/Experimentation+iOS+Specific+Documentation)

#### 🤝 Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing 📖
Collaborating on tasks and objectives delivers better results and strengthens the team.
- Help Facilitate [Community of Practice](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/131631397/Community+of+Practice+-+CoP) sessions (and host a few of my own).
- Buddying new joiners and mentoring others, authored the [iOS Buddy Guide](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/3204940222/iOS+Engineer+Onboarding+Buddy+Guide).
- Contributor to the [iOS Engineering Knowledge Base](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/3202385330/iOS+Engineering+Knowledge+Base+Directory)
- I occasionaly write [articles](https://medium.com/asos-techblog/empowering-your-developers-to-think-creatively-7fd7f3352d50)

#### 🏡 Homepage and Content Hub 💅
The Homepage is like the front of our store. It is the first impression the user has.
I have contributed to the homepage a lot over the past year or so and available as a point of contact for any queries.
