## Hi :wave:,
My name is Callum, an **iOS Engineer** on the Web and Apps Team. 

I joined ASOS on July 2019.

### Some Areas of focus
I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. My areas of focus don't limit me in what I can explore.

#### 📈 Experimentation and Measurement 📏
- Point of contact for Experimentation on the iOS Platform. 
- I maintain the `ASOSExperimentation` iOS Project and the `URL Injection Framework`
- Maintain the [iOS Experimentation Documentation](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/2117176939/Experimentation+iOS+Specific+Documentation)
- 3YP Feature Delivery

- Help Facilitate [Community of Practice](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/131631397/Community+of+Practice+-+CoP) sessions (and host a few of my own).
- Buddying new joiners and mentoring others, authored the [iOS Buddy Guide](https://asoscom.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/APPS/pages/3204940222/iOS+Engineer+Onboarding+Buddy+Guide).
